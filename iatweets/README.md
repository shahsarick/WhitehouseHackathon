A pair of utilities that Nick Mapsy (NickSto) and The Doctor (virtadpt) wrote for the Internet Archive White House data hackathon on 7 January 2016.

parse_warc.py is a utility written by Nick that parses WARC files without using the existing Python modules to do so.

crawl.py is a utility written by Nick that crawls Twitter for replies to archived tweets and extract them.

The tweets we were working with can be found here as a single JSON document: https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/tweets.json.bz2
